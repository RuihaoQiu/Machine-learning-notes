# Machine learning notes

This is a very personal notes of machine learning study, recording my understanding on various topics, methods and ideas.



------

- ### Basic concepts


- ### Classification

  #### Nearest neighbor — _k_ NN

  #### Naive Bayes

  #### Support vector machine -- SVM

  #### Decision tree

  ​

- ### Regression

Assume that we have a set of labeled examples with different features. We would like to find a good way to separate the examples with certain features. This classification can be used to predict new properties of unknow data. _e.g._ cat and tiger -- size, color, sound, ... 

- **Decision surface/boundary:** the surface that well separate given data.



#### Regression

The output variables are continous. _e.g._ height -- weight



### Unsupervised learning

Examples without labels. _e.g._ credit default of bank customers

#### Clustering

Discover groups of similar examples.
