# Machine learning notes
This is a very personal notes of machine learning study, recording my understanding on various topics, methods and ideas.

# Basic concepts
## Supervised learning
### Classification
Assume that we have a set of labeled examples with different features. We would like to find a good way to separate the examples with certain features.This classification can be used to predict new properties of unknow data. _e.g._ cat and tiger -- size, color, sound, ... 

- **Decision surface/boundary:** the surface that well separate given data.

Models:
1. **Nearest neighbor**
2. **Naive Bayes**
3. **SVM -- Support vector machine**
4. **Decision tree**

### Regression
The output variables are continous. _e.g._ height -- weight
## Unsupervised learning
Examples without labels. _e.g._ credit default of bank customers
### Clustering
Discover groups of similar examples.
