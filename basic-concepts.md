# Basic concepts
## Supervised learning
### Classification
Assume that we have a set of labeled examples with different features.  
We would like to find a good way to separate the examples with certain features.  
This classification can be used to predict new properties of unknow data.  
**Decision surface/boundary:** the surface that well separate given data.  
_e.g._ cat and tiger -- size, color, sound, ...
### Regression
The output variables are continous.  
_e.g._ height -- weight
## Unsupervised learning
Examples without labels.
### Clustering
Discover groups of similar examples.  
_e.g._ credit default of bank customers
